# This script is to rename the antiSMASH gbks for them to include the species and strain names, taken from the directory name.
# The argument it requires is the name of the directory with the AntiSMASH output, which must NOT contain a slash at the end.

# Usage for one AntiSMASH output directory:
# 	sh change-names.sh <folder>

# Usage for multiple AntiSMASH output directory:
# 	for species in <output-directory-pattern*>
# 		do
# 			sh change-names.sh $species
# 		done



ls -1 "$1"/*region*gbk | while read line # enlist the gbks of all regions in the directory and start a while loop
 do
	dir=$(echo $line | cut -d'/' -f1) # save the directory name in a variable 
	file=$(echo $line | cut -d'/' -f2) # save the file name in a variable
    for directory in $dir # start a for loop
        do
        	cd $directory # enter the directory
          newfile=$(echo $dir-$file) # make a new variable that fuses the directory name with the file name
 			    echo "Renaming" $file " to" $newfile # print a message showing the old and new file names
 			    mv $file $newfile # rename
 			    cd .. # return to main directory befor it beggins again
